# smart_cooking

Flutter application for searching recipes.

# Now

App uses 2 API's. 

[First API](https://rapidapi.com/spoonacular/api/recipe-food-nutrition) is used for getting recipes.

[Second API](https://pleasurecookings.azurewebsites.net/swagger/ui/index#/) was created for the needs of the academic's project by [my colleague](https://github.com/mbazych). This API allows us to add accounts where we are able to keep our favourite recipes and history of recipes.



# In future

App is using only one account being automatically signing in without typing username or password. It is happenning because it is only test for now. In the near future I'm going to add register and login forms.  
I'll try add posibility for creating own recipes by users. It's going to be kept in our data base. Then try to shuffle recipes form first and second API's.
